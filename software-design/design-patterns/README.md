# Software Design Patterns - Challenges

These exercises test your ability to apply design patterns in realistic scenarios. The first three ask you to design a solution from scratch. The last one gives you existing, tightly coupled code that you should refactor using the concepts from this session.

## Summoning Circle

Imagining implementing a creature summoning feature for a fantasy game. The player can interact with a summoning circle, injects ingredients of a specific type and the summoning circle creates a magic creature of that type.

Implement the SummoningCirclce with the factory pattern:

define an interface Creature with name: string and a method useAbility: which prints a message what the creature does.
Create multiple classes which implement the creature interface. Some suggestions: a Dragon class with the ability breathing fire, a Phoenix class with ability Reborn, a Unicorn class with ability Dancing on rainbow.
Create the Factory class SummoningCircle with a method called summon(ingredientType: string). Depending on the ingridient type (fire, air, sparkles, etc) a different Creature class is created and returned.
Use the Summoning circle with different ingredients.

## The API request builder

Design a flexible way to construct HTTP requests without a single, optional-heavy configuration object.

Implement a RequestBuilder class that allows method chaining for setting the HTTP method, URL, headers, query parameters, and a JSON body.
The build() method must validate the configuration before returning the final immutable Request object. It should throw an error if the method is POST but no body was provided, or if the URL has not been set.

## E-commerce state machine

Build an Order class that manages its lifecycle using a state machine.

Define the exact states: Draft, Paid, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled.
Define the legal events: checkout, payment_received, dispatch, confirm_delivery, cancel.
Implement the following possible state changes:
Draft can change to Paid and Cancelled,
Paid can change to Shipped and Cancelled
Shipped can change to Delivered`

## The monolithic log exporter

The class below violates the Single Responsibility Principle by managing its own database connection, and violates the Open/Closed Principle by using a hardcoded if/else chain to pick the output format.

function getMockDB() {
return {
query(select: string): string[] {
return ["lorem", "ipsum", "dolor"];
},
};
}

class LogExporter {
async exportLogs(format: "json" | "csv" | "xml") {
const db = getMockDB();
const logs = await db.query("SELECT \* FROM system_logs");

    if (format === "json") {
      return JSON.stringify(logs);
    } else if (format === "csv") {
      return logs
        .map((l) => `${l.timestamp},${l.level},${l.message}`)
        .join("\n");
    } else if (format === "xml") {
      return `<logs>${logs.map((l) => `<log>${l.message}</log>`).join("")}</logs>`;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Unknown format");
    }

}
}
Refactor in two steps:

Repository and DI: Extract a LogRepository interface. Inject it into LogExporter so the class no longer knows about the database connection.
Factory: Extract the formatting logic into an ExporterFactory function or class. It should take the format string and return a concrete formatter instance (JsonFormatter, CsvFormatter, XmlFormatter). Update LogExporter to rely on the factory instead of inline conditionals.
