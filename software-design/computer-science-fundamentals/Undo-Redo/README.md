# Software Design CS Fundamentals - Challenges

## Big O reasoning

Each snippet below takes an array arr of length n. Assign a Big O complexity class to each one and write a sentence justifying your answer.

// snippet 1
function first(arr) {
return arr[0];
}
// snippet 2
function second(arr) {
let total = 0;
for (const value of arr) {
total += value;
}
return total;
}
// snippet 3
function third(arr) {
for (const a of arr) {
for (const b of arr) {
if (a === b) console.log(a);
}
}
}
// snippet 4
function fourth(arr) {
for (const value of arr) {
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
console.log(value, i);
}
}
}
// snippet 5
function fifth(arr) {
if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
return [...fifth(arr.slice(0, mid)), ...fifth(arr.slice(mid))];
}

## Implement insertion sort

Write an insertionSort function that takes an array of numbers and returns it sorted in ascending order. Match the algorithm from the algorithms file: walk the array from the second element onwards, and for each element, slide it left past every larger value until it lands in the right place.

function insertionSort(arr) {
// your code here
}

console.log(insertionSort([5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]));
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
A few things to decide while implementing:

whether to mutate the input array or work on a copy
how the inner loop knows when to stop sliding the current value
what happens for an empty array or an array of length one
Once it works, test it on three inputs and count how many comparisons it makes for each:

an already-sorted array, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a reverse-sorted array, e.g. [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
a single-element array [42]
The already-sorted and single-element cases should be cheap. The reverse-sorted case should be expensive. That gap is what the algorithms file means when it says insertion sort is O(n²) worst case but O(n) best case.

## Undo / Redo

Build a small UI with one text input and two buttons, Undo and Redo, that uses two stacks to track edit history. Use vanilla TypeScript and HTML.

The state to track is the current value of the input plus two stacks:

a back stack, holding earlier values of the input
a forward stack, holding values that have been undone
The behavior on each action:

on every change to the input, push the previous value onto back, update the current value to the new one, and empty forward
on Undo (when back is non-empty), push the current value onto forward, pop the top of back, and set it as the current value
on Redo (when forward is non-empty), push the current value onto back, pop the top of forward, and set it as the current value
disable the Undo button when back is empty, and the Redo button when forward is empty
