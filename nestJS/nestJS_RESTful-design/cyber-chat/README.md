# NestJS RESTful Design - Challenges

## Cyber Chat, Speak REST

Cyber Chat persists to SQLite now, but the API surface is still rough. Lets apply the best practices regarding RESTful design to the API.

### Task 1: The Request Boundary

Create CreateThreadDto and UpdateThreadDto in threads/dto/. The create DTO should require title, body, and author, each with sensible class-validator rules and length limits. The update DTO should extend PartialType(CreateThreadDto) from @nestjs/mapped-types.
Create CreateCommentDto in comments/dto/ with body and author. The thread ID comes from the URL, not the body.
Register a global ValidationPipe in main.ts with whitelist, forbidNonWhitelisted, transform, and transformOptions.enableImplicitConversion enabled.
Update every controller method that accepts a body to use the typed DTO instead of a plain object.
Add a PATCH /threads/:id route so threads can be updated without sending the full representation.

### Task 2: The Response Boundary

Create ThreadResponseDto and CommentResponseDto. Mark every exposed field with @Expose(). Use @Type(() => Date) on the createdAt field so it serializes as a real Date.
Register ClassSerializerInterceptor globally in main.ts with excludeExtraneousValues: true.
Update the services to map TypeORM entities to response DTOs with plainToInstance before returning. No service method should return a raw entity.
Confirm that adding a new column to the Thread entity does not change the API response. The new column should stay invisible to clients until it is opted into the response DTO.

### Task 3: Status Codes and Exceptions

Replace any manual status-code wrangling with NestJS exceptions. NotFoundException for missing threads or comments. BadRequestException where the request itself is malformed beyond what ValidationPipe catches.
Decorate the DELETE handlers with @HttpCode(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT) so a successful delete returns 204 with no body.
Confirm POST /threads and POST /threads/:id/comments return 201 Created. Confirm GET /threads/:id returns 200 OK.
Apply ParseUUIDPipe to every :id path parameter on both controllers. A request to GET /threads/not-a-uuid should return 400 Bad Request before the handler runs.

### Task 4: Paginated Thread Listing

Create PaginationQueryDto in a shared location with page (default 1, minimum 1) and limit (default 10, minimum 1, maximum 100). Both must be positive integers. Use @Type(() => Number) so the string values from the URL get converted.
Update GET /threads to accept the DTO through @Query().
Update ThreadsService.findAll to return { data, meta: { page, limit, total, totalPages } } using findAndCount. Map the rows through plainToInstance(ThreadResponseDto, ...) before they leave the service.
Verify that the response shape stays consistent whether or not the client passes pagination parameters.

### Bonus

Sort threads by createdAt descending by default. Accept ?sort=-createdAt or ?sort=createdAt on the list endpoint to flip the order. Reject any other sort value with a 400.
Filter threads by author with ?author=<name> on the list endpoint. Combine the filter with pagination so ?author=ada&page=2 works as expected.
Write a custom ParseDatePipe that takes a date string from a query parameter (for example, ?startDate=2026-05-27), validates that it is a parseable date, and transforms it into a native JavaScript Date object. If the provided string is invalid, the pipe should throw a BadRequestException (yielding a 400 Bad Request response). Apply this pipe to a @Query('startDate') parameter in one of your controller endpoints.
:exclamation: Since we have not built a custom pipe together yet, you will need to consult the documentation to see how the PipeTransform interface is structured. NestJS Documentation: Custom Pipes
