# NestJS Basics 1 - Challenges

## Quote API

Build a NestJS application that serves quotes from a static dataset.

## Requirements

Use NestJS with a Controller, a Service, and a Module
GET /quotes returns all quotes
GET /quotes/random returns a single randomly selected quote
The Service holds and manages the quote data. The Controller handles the routes and calls the Service. Both are registered in the root Module.
