# Coding Challenge: Conway’s Game of Life

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a “zero-player game,” meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Your task is to build a command-line interface (CLI) version of this simulation using a fixed **50x50 grid**.

## 1. The Rules of the World

The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of cells. Each cell is in one of two possible states: **alive** or **dead**. Every generation, the grid transitions based on the following four rules:

1. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
2. **Survival**: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.

## 2. Technical Requirements

- **Fixed Grid**: The simulation must run on a strictly defined grid of **50 rows and 50 columns**.
- **CLI Rendering**: Choose 2 characters tor represent dead or alive cells (i.e. “#” and “.”).
- **Frame Rendering**: The screen should refresh or clear for each new generation to create an animation effect.
- **Initial State**: Allow the user to start the simulation with a random distribution of live cells or a predefined pattern (like a “Glider” or “Pulsar”).
- **The Loop**: The program should calculate the next generation based on the current state and display it, ideally with a small delay (e.g., 100ms) between frames.
